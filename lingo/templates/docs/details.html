            Lingo Cafe is an open community of people from all over the world practising language and socializing.
        </p>

        <p class="my-4">
            We meet over online video conference calls.
            Sessions last 2 hours and host up to 100 participants.
            Conversations take place in smaller groups of usually up to 5 people.
        </p>

        <p class="my-4">
            Each meeting has one topic language.
            Participants are expected to have at least a very basic level of understanding the session language.
        </p>

        <p class="my-4">
            During the sessions, hosts guide the participants by facilitating conversations and assisting them during their practices.
        </p>

        <p class="my-4">
            Anyone having fluency in the language of the session can volunteer to be a co-host.
            Please indicate your intention to co-host a meeting when you are signing up.
            If it is your first time, an experienced host will guide you through the process.
